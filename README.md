The code
The code for the application is in the src/App.js file. The main components of the application are the Form component and the Input component.

The Form component is responsible for creating the form and handling the validation. It uses the useForm hook from React Hook Form to create a form state object. The form state object contains the values of the form fields, as well as the errors that have been detected.

The Input component is a simple component that renders an input field. It takes the name of the input field as a prop, and it uses the value from the form state object to set the initial value of the input field.

Validation
The Form component uses the validate prop to specify the validation rules for each input field. The validation rules are defined using a function that takes the value of the input field as a parameter and returns a boolean value. If the value of the input field does not meet the validation rules, the function will return false, and the error message will be displayed.
